                <p>The Federal Republic of Nigeria, commonly referred to as Nigeria is a country in West Africa,
                    bordering
                    Benin in the west, Chad and Cameroon in the east, and Niger in the north. Its coast in the south is
                    located on the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean. The federal republic comprises 36 states and
                    the
                    Federal Capital Territory,where the capital, Abuja is located. Nigeria is officially a democratic
                    secular country. <br>Nigeria is often referred to as the "Giant of Africa", owing to its large
                    population and economy. With 186 million inhabitants, Nigeria is the most populous country in
                    Africa
                    and the seventh most populous country in the world. As of 2015, Nigeria is the world's 20th largest
                    economy, worth more than $500 billion and $1 trillion in terms of nominal GDP and purchasing power
                    parity respectively. It overtook South Africa to become Africa's largest economy in 2014. The 2013
                    debt-to-GDP ratio was 11 percent. Nigeria is considered to be an emerging market by the World Bank;
                    it
                    has been identified as a regional power on the African continent, a middle power in international
                    affairs, and has also been identified as an emerging global power.</p>

                    <p>Lagos is a city in the Nigerian state of Lagos. The city, with its adjoining conurbation, is the
                        most
                        populous in Nigeria, and the most populous on the African continent. It is one of the fastest
                        growing
                        cities in the world, and also one of the most populous urban agglomerations. Lagos is a major
                        financial
                        centre in Africa; the megacity has the highest GDP, and also houses one of the largest and
                        busiest
                        ports on the continent.
                        Lagos State is a major economic centre of Nigeria. It would be the fifth largest economy in
                        Africa
                        if
                        it were a country. Its total generated revenue in 2017 was around US$920 million, growing by
                        10.43%
                        compared to 2016.</p>

                        Territory (FCT). It is a planned city and was built mainly in the 1980s, replacing the

                        most
                        populous city of Lagos as the capital on 12 December 1991. Abuja's geography is defined by Aso

                        400-metre (1,300 ft) monolith left by water erosion. The Presidential Complex, National

                    <p>Port Harcourt is the capital and largest city of Rivers State, Nigeria. It lies along the Bonny
                        River
                        and is located in the Niger Delta. In 1956 crude oil was discovered in commercial quantities at
                        Oloibiri, and Port Harcourt's economy turned to petroleum when the first shipment of Nigerian
                        crude
                        oil
                        was exported through the city in 1958. Through the benefits of the Nigerian petroleum industry,
                        Port
                        Harcourt was further developed, with aspects of modernization such as overpasses, city blocks,
                        taller
                        and more substantial buildings. Oil firms that currently have offices in the city include Royal
                        Dutch Shell and Chevron.</p>
